Collection of scripts used to process and organize photos and video


Originally, this collection of scripts was created to facilitate 
my migration of photos and videos out of iPhoto into a generic folder 
hierarchy accessible by any number of photo/video tools, or no tool
at all.

Since then, it also includes at least one script specifically designed
as a frontend to the exellect 'exiftool' 
( http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ ) which helps sort a 
pile of photo and video files into appropriate locations.
